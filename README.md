## 🚨 The Problem

Manufacturing facilities that produce printed circuit boards (PCBs) rely heavily on manual visual inspection to catch defects — a process that is slow, inconsistent, and impossible to scale without significant labour cost. When a defective product slips through, there is often no automated audit trail linking the defect back to the specific batch, operator, shift, or production line that produced it.

**Key pain points:**

- ⚠️ **No traceability** — defective products cannot be reliably traced back to their manufacturing context (batch, shift, operator, location)
- ⚠️ **Manual inspection is inconsistent** — human inspectors miss defects under fatigue and cannot maintain throughput at scale
- ⚠️ **Inspection and record-keeping are disconnected** — quality results are not automatically written back to the product's database record in real time
- ⚠️ **No immediate on-line feedback** — operators on the production floor have no instant signal when a defective product is scanned

---

## 🎯 Our Solution & Purpose

**Smart Automated System for Product Labeling and Traceability** is an end-to-end IoT and AI pipeline that authenticates products via barcode scan and immediately runs AI-powered defect detection on the associated PCB image, writing the quality result back to a live traceability database and displaying it on the scanning station in real time.

It solves the above by:

1. **Unified scan-to-result pipeline** — a single barcode scan triggers product verification, AI inspection, database logging, and operator display without any manual steps in between
2. **YOLOv11n defect detection** — a model trained on seven PCB defect classes (missing holes, mouse bites, open circuits, shorts, spurs, spurious copper, background) with >95% precision and >85% mAP@0.5
3. **Permanent audit trail** — every scan updates the product record in MongoDB with quality status, defect type, and timestamp, creating a traceable history per barcode

### Flow Explanation

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| **Barcode Scan** | GM805L reads an EAN-13 barcode and sends it to the ESP32 via Serial2. ESP32 extracts the 13-digit code and sends a POST request to the Node.js server over WiFi. |
| **DB Lookup** | Node.js queries MongoDB for the scanned barcode. If not found, a 404 is returned immediately and the TFT shows NOT FOUND. |
| **Record Update** | On a match, `last_scanned_at` is updated and the product's `product_id` is forwarded to the ML service. |
| **Image Load** | FastAPI searches `pcb_with_barcodes/` for the image matching `*_{product_id}.png`. |
| **Barcode Extraction** | pyzbar extracts the barcode string from the image for cross-verification. |
| **Masking** | The barcode region is white-filled so YOLO does not confuse barcode lines for PCB defects. |
| **Defect Detection** | YOLOv11n runs inference at conf=0.25. Each detected box returns a class name and confidence score. |
| **DB Write** | `quality_status` (defective / no_defect) and `defect_type` are written back to the product record in MongoDB. |
| **Display** | The full result travels back through Node.js to the ESP32 and is rendered on the TFT screen for the operator. |

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MNADITYA05/Smart-Automated-System-for-Product-Labeling-and-Traceability.git
cd Smart-Automated-System-for-Product-Labeling-and-Traceability
```

### 2. Configure the Server

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env        # Fill in MONGO_URI, PORT, ML_API_URL
npm install
```

### 3. Seed the Database

```bash
# Inside server/
npm run seed
```

This imports all product records from `data/pcb_traceability_labeled_dataset.csv` into MongoDB.

### 4. Configure and Start the ML Service

```bash
cd ../ml
cp .env.example .env        # Fill in MONGO_URI, IMAGE_DIR, MODEL_PATH
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

On first run, `detector.py` will automatically download `best.pt` from GitHub Releases if it is not present locally.

### 5. Start the Node.js Server

```bash
cd ../server
npm start
```

### 6. Flash the Firmware

Open `firmware/Barcode Scanner.ino` in Arduino IDE. Edit `firmware/config.h` with your WiFi credentials and server IP, then upload to the ESP32.

```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID     "your-wifi-name"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "your-wifi-password"
#define BACKEND_URL   "http://<your-server-ip>:5050/lookup"
```

### 7. Verify the Setup

```
✅ MongoDB running on port 27017
✅ ML service running at http://localhost:8000
✅ Node.js server running at http://localhost:5050
✅ ESP32 connected to WiFi — IP shown on TFT display
```

## 💡 Usage

### Scan a Product

Point the GM805L scanner at any EAN-13 barcode on a seeded product. The TFT display will show the result within seconds.

**Matched product — no defect:**
```
✅ MATCHED
Product: AABAN010625001
MFG: 01-06-2025
Barcode: 1120106250013
Quality: no_defect
```

**Matched product — defective:**
```
✅ MATCHED
Product: AABAN010625001
MFG: 01-06-2025
Barcode: 1120106250013
Quality: defective
```

**Unknown barcode:**
```
❌ NOT FOUND
```

### Start the Live Dashboard

```bash
cd ml
streamlit run dashboard/live.py
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8501` — filter by shift, quality status, or defect type across all scanned records.

### Common Commands

## 🛤 Known Limitations & Roadmap

### Current Limitations

- ⚠️ **Pre-stored images only** — PCB images must be manually placed in `pcb_with_barcodes/`; live camera capture is not yet wired into the ML pipeline
- ⚠️ **No dashboard authentication** — the Streamlit dashboard is open to anyone on the local network
- ⚠️ **PCB-specific model** — the YOLOv11n model is trained exclusively on PCB defects and does not generalise to other product types
- ⚠️ **Local MongoDB only** — no cloud deployment supported; MongoDB must run on the same machine as the server
- ⚠️ **Lighting-sensitive barcode extraction** — pyzbar can fail on low-resolution or poorly lit images
- ⚠️ **WiFi credentials require reflash** — `config.h` changes require re-uploading firmware to the ESP32

### Roadmap

| Status | Milestone | Target |
|:---:|---|---|
| ✅ Done | Core scan → verify → inspect → log pipeline | v1.0 |
| ✅ Done | Live Streamlit monitoring dashboard | v1.0 |
| ✅ Done | Model weights hosted on GitHub Releases with auto-download | v1.0 |
| 📋 Planned | Live camera capture integrated into ML pipeline | v1.1 |
| 📋 Planned | MongoDB Atlas support for cloud deployment | v1.1 |
| 📋 Planned | Dashboard authentication layer | v1.1 |
| 💡 Exploring | OTA firmware configuration for WiFi and server URL | Future |
| 💡 Exploring | Multi-product defect model (beyond PCBs) | Future |
